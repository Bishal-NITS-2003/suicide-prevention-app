# 🧠 AI-Powered Suicide Prevention System

Student mental health in India is in crisis. In places like Kota, the academic pressure has led to tragic outcomes — with dozens of student suicides every year. Pause Reflect Breathe is our response. We’ve built an AI-powered suicide prevention platform that conducts weekly emotional check-ins through text, voice, and video — identifying early signs of mental distress and enabling timely intervention. This is not just a tool. It’s a system designed to uncover hidden pain, offer support, and protect young lives — before it's too late.
